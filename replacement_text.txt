    8. **Liquidated Damages**
       - **DETECTION KEYWORDS (Case-Insensitive, search ENTIRE document):**
         - "liquidated damages", "liquidated or other damages", "LD", "L.D."
         - "damages for delay", "delay damages", "assessed damages"
         - "damages against subcontractor", "share of damages"
         - "damages assessed", "amount of such assessment"
       - **a) Applicability**
         - IF LDs or liquidated damages language included THEN Action: MODIFY (or ACKNOWLEDGE)
         - Response: "ABS is only liable for delays beyond durations specifically allocated to our scope, independent of global delays or resequencing. Durations commence only when work areas are fully ready and accessible. Delays caused by others do not apply. Liquidated damages apply only if ABS exceeds its adjusted completion date. Amounts assessed must be equitable to ABS' contract amount. Please acknowledge."
         - Reasoning: "Liquidated damages must be proportionate, duration and scope-specific, and tied to conditions within ABS's control."

    8A. **Delay Damages / Schedule Shifting (SEPARATE FROM LIQUIDATED DAMAGES)**
       - **DETECTION KEYWORDS (Case-Insensitive, search ENTIRE document):**
         - "delay damage", "delay damages", "actual delay damages"
         - "delay beyond", "damages for delay", "delay cost"
         - "proportional delay", "share of responsibility for the delay"
         - "no-damage-for-delay", "no damage for delay"
         - "schedule shift", "schedule change", "resequencing"
         - "start-date shift", "schedule adjustment"
         - "waiver", "waive recovery", "waives"
         - "lost productivity", "idle time", "acceleration"
         - "extended overhead", "general conditions extension"
         - "contractor-caused delay", "owner-caused delay"
         - "delay clause", "time extension"
       - **APPLICABILITY:**
         IF the contract includes language that:
         - Allows the Contractor to assess actual delay damages against the Subcontractor
         - Passes through delay damages from the Prime Agreement
         - Waives subcontractor recovery for Contractor-caused or Owner-caused delays
         - Waives recovery for schedule shifts "for convenience"
         - Includes any delay clause of any kind
         - Addresses lost productivity, idle time, acceleration, or extended overhead
         THEN Action: MODIFY
       - **Response:** "ABS shall be responsible only for delay damages to the extent directly and solely caused by ABS and proportionate to its scope of work. ABS shall not be liable for Contractor, Subcontractor, or Owner caused delays, schedule changes, or global delays. Schedule adjustments shall include equitable time relief, and cost relief where applicable."
       - **Reasoning:** "Delay risk must be allocated to the party that controls the cause of delay. Provisions that allow unilateral schedule changes, waive recovery for non-ABS delays, or expose ABS to uncapped actual delay damages create disproportionate risk unrelated to ABS's scope or control."
       - **RELATIONSHIP TO LIQUIDATED DAMAGES:** This rule is SEPARATE from Rule 8 (Liquidated Damages). LDs cap damages; Delay clauses expand them. Both must be reviewed independently.
